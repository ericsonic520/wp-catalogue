== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I sell products through this plugin? =

No. There are already lots of good eCommerce plugins that you can use to sell things. WP Catalogue is different - it is used for people who want to show a catalogue of products ONLY, not for selling things online.

= How can I customise the design? =

You can do some basic presentation adjustments via WP Catalogue > Settings. Beyond this, you can completely customise the design via your theme css. 

= Where can I get support for this plugin? =

If you've tried all the obvious stuff and it's still not working please request support via the forum.
